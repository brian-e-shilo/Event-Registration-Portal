# Event Registration Portal

**Introduction to JSP and Servlet-based Web Applications**

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used to create dynamic web content by using Java in combination with HTML. JSP allows for the embedding of Java code directly into HTML pages, providing a way to build interactive web applications. Servlets complement JSP by handling requests and responses in a Java web application, forming a powerful duo for building dynamic, server-side applications.

**Problem Statement: Registration Process for an Expert Talk on "Web Services"**

You are tasked with developing a registration system for an expert talk on "Web Services." The system should manage participant registrations, track the maximum number of participants per category, and generate a participation report. Participants can be students, researchers, or software engineers, each with a fixed registration fee. The event limits the number of participants to 15 per category, and registrations should close once this limit is reached.

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Registration Form**:
   1. Provide a form for participants to enter their personal details:
      1. Name
      1. ID
      1. Designation (Student, Researcher, Software Engineer)
      1. Affiliation
      1. Fee (automatically determined based on designation)
   1. Validate the input to ensure all necessary information is provided.
1. **Registration Fee**:
   1. The registration fee is determined by the participant's designation:
      1. Students: ₹500
      1. Researchers: ₹1000
      1. Software Engineers: ₹2000
1. **Participant Limits**:
   1. Limit the number of participants to 15 for each category.
   1. Display a message "Registration Full" when the limit for any category is reached.
1. **Participation Report**:
   1. Generate a report containing the list of participant details for each category once registration is complete.

You can develop a robust registration system for an expert talk on "Web Services" using JSP and Servlets. The system will handle participant registrations, ensure category limits are respected, and generate detailed participation reports. This ensures a smooth registration process and effective event management.

I have attached the complete pdf, which is also the same file that I had submitted as an assignment for my college earlier this year. It illustrates everything in detail.

Hope you find it helpful!
